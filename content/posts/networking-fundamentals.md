**Host**

A host is any device which send or receive traffic
e.g Laptop, cloud servers, and even IoT devices such as TV, smart watches, and lights

Types of hosts

- Client - They initiate requests
- Servers - They respond to requests

**PS:** Clients and servers are basically computers communicating with each other. At any point, they can switch roles depending on the setup.

**IP Address**

An IP address is the identity of each host. And every host must have an IP address. For everything sent on the internet from a host, there's a _source IP_ and _destination IP_. IP addresses are 32 bits, and they are made up of 4 instances of a number from 0-255. An example of an IP address - 136.22.17.98.

In a process called subnettting, IP addresses are assigned based on heirachy. For instance, an IP 10.30.55.127 could mean, 10 - Host at ACME, 30 - Based in London, 55 - in an engineering department.

**Network**

A network is when 2 or more hosts are connected. Networking is a system of automating these connections. A network can contain other networks, called sub-networks or subnets. Therefore, the internet as we know it, is a bunch of networks connected to each other.
